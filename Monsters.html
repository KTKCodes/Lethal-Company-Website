            <p>Baboon Hawks will only attack employees when they are in equal or greater numbers in comparison to said employees and will 
                not attack if the aforementioned troop is smaller than the employee group. However, if the groups are of equal size, the 
                flying primates will be more hesitant to attack. This behavior makes it wise to stick with teammates when a baboon hawk troop is nearby to reduce the risk of being attacked.
                Baboon Hawks back off when stared at by employees, maintaining a gap between themselves and the employee. However, they will eventually go into an attacking state if watched for too long.
                If there are not enough Baboon Hawks in a troop, they will maintain a healthy distance from employees, but will still follow them.
                Baboon Hawks can steal dropped scrap and angered to the point of attacking an employee if said employee tries to take back the scrap.</p>

                Only 1 Bracken can spawn per-map. It can be spooked if an employee glances at it, but will attack if stared at directly for roughly 2 seconds.
                The Bracken can be spotted through closed doors (including locked doors), even if the player cannot see the Bracken. Direct eye contact with a Bracken may halt its retreat.
                Staring at a retreating Bracken raises its anger slower than an idle Bracken.</p>

                Employees can take turns watching a Coil-Head while each of them moves to a safer location. Employees can also "lead" Coil-Heads around by rapidly looking away, then back at them.
                Coil-Heads require a direct line of sight, unlike many "weeping angel" type enemies from other games. 
                This means that if you step behind a wall and lose sight of the Coil-Head, it will be free to move unless it intersects your line of sight again.

                of attack with a fast enough reaction time and low enough weight; therefore, the best strategy is to drop heavy items (such as large axles or bottles) and run away.

                Crouching suppresses the noise the player makes from walking, allowing players to avoid the Eyeless Dogs as long as they do not physically bump into them.</p>
